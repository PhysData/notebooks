    "### Why Visualise Data?\n",
    "Visualisation is an essential component of data science, used to emphasise patterns, structures and outliers hidden in large quantities of numerical data. This aims to communicate key insights obtained by data analysis in a visual and intuitive way, such that they can be easily understood by other physicists, business professionals, managers and even the general public.\n",
